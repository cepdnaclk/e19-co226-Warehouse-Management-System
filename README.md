## Purpose of a Warehouse Management System:

The warehouse management system database is designed to help warehouse managers track and
manage inventory levels and orders.
Using this database, warehouse managers can generate reports on inventory levels, product sales, and
supplier performance to help make informed decisions. The database also provides a user interface for
managing the database, including adding or editing products, suppliers, and orders, and generating
reports.
Overall, the warehouse management system database is a powerful tool that enables warehouse
managers to efficiently manage their inventory and orders, providing high-quality service to their
customers while minimizing errors and maximizing efficiency.
